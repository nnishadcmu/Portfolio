## Part III

### Outline
The objective of this project is to raise awareness among every demographic group about the numbers of children who are victims of child labor. The data story also intends to make the audience aware of the slow progress in terms of child labor eradication and steps they can take to raise awareness. The target audience for my website includes all demographic groups with access to computers, smart phones and/or tablets. 
In order to make the story work for my audience, I interviewed several individuals, from different backgrounds, gender and age group (including teens). I used a child laborâ€™s story to give the audience a preview of what a typical day can look like for the victims of child labor. The audience seemed to connect with the personal story which further drew their interest to the website. The data visualizations were created with Infogram, Datawrapper and Tableau and keeping the general public in mind. The visualizations were kept simple, so everyone can easily understand the purpose of it. The final story was built using Shorthand.
