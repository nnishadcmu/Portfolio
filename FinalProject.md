# Final Project Overview

## Part 1

#### Outline
The project will be to bring awareness to the child labor issues around the world. I am interested in showing the child labor rates across the world and the impact it has on the wellbeing of the children. Child labor issues are very serious and overcoming it will not be easy. However, my goal is to show how we can we can help as civilians.

#### Data
The data for the current statistics will come from the International Labour Organization’s webpage: https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/child-labour/lang--en/index.htm

The data for the child labor based on different countries: https://ilostat.ilo.org/topics/child-labour/ 

The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) website: https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/percentage-children-aged-5-14-years-engaged-child-labour-sex-place-residence-household-wealth-quintile/
https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-protection/child-labour/

Children in Employment - https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.0714.ZS?end=2016&start=2016&view=bar

#### Method and Medium
I plan on building a story using Shorthand. The story will provide an introduction to the problem around the globe. I will use data visualization to highlight the regions with the most amount of child labors in the world. Other visualizations in the introduction will include current numbers and gender specific statistics. 
Next will draw attention to the impact of child labor. Since a lot of the health effects are not noticeable until later life, it is difficult to quantify the effects. Therefore, I was unable to find raw data to use. In this section I will point out some research findings on the impact of hazardous work environment for children. I plan on using infogram to build a statistical infographic to highlight facts and research finding. 
The next section is to show the change in child labor number over the years. I plan on using a bar chart to show the difference. I will use the data found on UNICEF’s website and ILO’s website to represent the change and point out the slow progress.
I will include a video found on UN’s website and finally include a section for call to action. These are going to be text.
