Hello! I am Nuvia Nishad. I am a student in the Telling Stories with Data class at Carnegie Mellon University. I am a first year Master of Public Management student at the Heinz College and a full time HR Recruiter for the University. I provide full life-cycle recruitment services for the University which includes helping hiring managers to develop recruitment strategies and identifying the best talent for the job. 

As a Recruiter, I enjoy learning about the organizational plans and finding candidates that fit with the goals of the university. I am personally passionate about process and performance improvements that ensure effectiveness and increase overall organizational performances. I want to continue to engage in such organizational development opportunities.

I am fluent in 3 languages and enjoy different cultural experiences. When I am not studying or working, I can be found exploring different parts of the city, country or the world. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn to simplify a lot of data and learn how to effectively represent them.
