Hello! I am Nuvia Nishad. I am a student in the Telling Stories with Data class at Carnegie Mellon University. I am a first year Master of Public Management student at the Heinz College and a full time HR Recruiter for the University. I provide full life-cycle recruitment services for the University which includes helping hiring managers to develop recruitment strategies and identifying the best talent for the job. 

As a Recruiter, I enjoy learning about the organizational plans and finding candidates that fit with the goals of the university. I am personally passionate about process and performance improvements that ensure effectiveness and increase overall organizational performances. I want to continue to engage in such organizational development opportunities.

I am fluent in 3 languages and enjoy different cultural experiences. When I am not studying or working, I can be found exploring different parts of the city, country or the world. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn to simplify a lot of data and learn how to effectively represent them.

## Data Visualization For Newspaper Readers

The target audience for this visualization are the readers of the New York Times. The approach of this visualization is to make the readers aware of the poor conditions in which children are detained at the southern borders of the U.S. The data visualizations are created to go with the news regarding the poor conditions at the Rio Grande Valley facilities. The visualizations point out the large number of children held at the facility for a prolonged times and with little to no access to amenities required by the Transport, Escort, Detention and Search Standards (TEDS). The report also points out the increase in number of children held at these facilities which is an indication that measures have to be taken to meet the increasing demand. I chose colors that are closer to the red color family to draw attention to the noncompliance of the TEDS. I chose a lighter shade to represent lesser polulation and a darker shade to represent more. I also used grey for areas I did not want to draw too much attention to. 


## Data Visualization For Inclusion in Report

The target audience for this visualization are the management at the Homeland Security. The intention of the data visualization is to make them aware of the significant increase in apprehension over the last year and the overcrowding that it happening at the border patrol facilities. The report also provides a breakdown of the demographics and the increases respective to specific groups. It also points out the potential cause of the overcrowding (i.e. individuals held for longer than 72 hours). I wanted to keep the visualizations simple and neutral in color so that the only thing to focus on would be the trends and the numbers. I used lighter blue to represent lesser populations and the darker to represent more. I picked shades of red when listing the facts because I wanted that to come across like an alert. The reason I used blues and reds was to remain consistent with the memorandum provided by the Inspector General. 


## Data Visualization Critique #2

For my review, I chose the bar chart titled “Gallons of paint sold in 2018, by channel and customer type” from the news article. The purpose of this article is to make readers aware of how PPG has fallen behind in sales compared to its competitor Sherwin-Williams. The chart used in this article points out that majority of the sales last year happened through manufacturer –owned stores. Since PPG has fewer stores than Sherwin – Williams, they did not make as much sales as their competitor. However, the bar chart also separates professional customers and do it yourself customers, which in my opinion is not necessary for the purpose of this article. It adds unnecessary information to the chart and takes away from the main purpose that is to show that PPG could benefit from having more stores.
