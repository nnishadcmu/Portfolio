## Part 2

### Outline 
This part of the project will walk my readers through the story. I have made some updates since submitting part 1 of the project. The updated sequence of the story is as follows:
1.	Introduction: Show my readers an actual day in a life of a laborer and then comparing that to the day of an average adult American. 
2.	Current Situation: Providing facts and numbers related to child labor in the world. Breaking that down into age groups.
3.	Effects of Child Labor: Listing some facts and research about the impact of hazardous work.
4.	Improvement Overtime: Show change in numbers over the years. Also highlight no reported data from major countries.
5.	Call to Action: Share several ways we can make a difference and raise awareness.

### Research Survey

#### Target Audience:
Child Labor is a global issue and my goal is to make sure that as many people as possible are aware of the problem. Therefore, my target audience of my website includes all demographics with access to computers and smart phones.

#### Script:
Hi,
My name is Nuvia Nishad. I am enrolled in the MPM Program at Heinz. I am currently working on creating a webpage about Child Labor Issues. Since it is still in the design phase, I am looking for some feedback about the overall content and layout of the website. I have a diagram to show you and a list of questions to ask afterwards. It should not take about 10 minutes of your time.

Here is a diagram of how I plan to design the website and the contents I wish to cover in each sections. Please take a moment to read the diagram.

Questions:
1. What resonated with you?
2. What do you think is the purpose of the website?
3. Did you find anything confusing?
4. Would you recommend adding/removing any content?
5. Did you know all the facts listed about child labor? Did you learn something new?

Thank you so much for your participation. This information will be very valuable as I continue to design the webpage. 

#### Survey Findings:

|Questions| Participant 1| Participant 2| Participant 3|
|:---------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:| 
|         |   Male, 27   |	Female, 32  |	  Male, 15   |
|What resonated with you?|It is bringing light to an issue that we don’t think of in the “first world” countries|Pharady’s story- we learned about similar stories but nothing ever gets done|Pharaday's strenuous efforts to earn a wage was very vibrant, it honestly made me feel terrible for the child. I would want to find out what I could do to help|
|What do you think is the purpose of the website?|To educate others|To spread awareness|There is an urgent need for more attention on the topic of child labor, which this page explicitly shows|
|Did you find anything confusing?|Not really|There are countries that has no data, but on the map it looks like they have 0 child labor. I would highlight the countries with no reported data|Completed charts would be helpful|
|Would you recommend adding/removing any content?| Would recommend including average American working hours as a comparison to Pharady’s day|What determines a victim of child labor? Is this including sex trafficking?|Links to other campaigns and charities that are for the same cause. In part 2 and 3 you repeated that 152 million children are victims of child labor, may be put them together?|
|Did you know all the facts listed about child labor? Did you learn something new?|I learned something new| No, I did not know the numbers. Yes, I learned something new|I knew that child labor was still a very important issue, however I didn't know that 152 million children are suffering due to their financial state, I'm glad that this information has been brought to me.|
			
 
#### Summary:
Changes to make:

1. Include average American working hours as a comparison to Pharady’s day
2. Update map to highlight countries with no reported data
3. Define what determines a victim of child labor? Is this including sex trafficking?
4. Links to other campaigns and charities.
